 /**
 *  Basic task (up to B+ level):
 *    - Ask the user for a whole number x.
 *    - Print whether x is EVEN or ODD.
 *    - If x is exactly 0, also print "ZERO" on its own line.
 *
 *  Moderate task (up to A level): 
 *    - Ask for a second whole number called total (a positive number).
 *    - Compute x divided by total as a DECIMAL calculation.
 *      * Example: if x = 37 and total = 90, print: "37/90 is 0.4111111111111111"
 *    - If total <= 0, print an error message and skip the percentage.
 *
 *  Challenge task (up to A+ level):
 *    - If x < 0 or x > 100, print "Wrong number!".
 *    - Otherwise:
 *        Check to see if x is a prime number. A prime number less than
 *        100 should be divisible by itself and 1 but not by 2, 3, 5, or 7.
 *        Print your results
